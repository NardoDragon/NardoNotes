# Ouroborous
- Dissambiguation page for [[Ouroborous Ring]], [[Ouroborous Stone]]
- The reason [[Moebius]] tells us that everyone is against us now...
- Also the reason we're disconnected from the [[Flame Clock]]
- Possibly the reason that we can 'see' the class symbols and change between them
	- [[Ethel]] was not able to see them, even after we broke the [[Flame Clock]] of [[Colony 4]]
