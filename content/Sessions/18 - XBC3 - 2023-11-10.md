# Plot
- [[Consul R]] is here! We just got to [[Colony 11]]
- [[Ashera]] doesn't want to kill the Consul
	- "It's a waste"
	- Wants a proper fight to the death
	- "Yes, I want to die."
- [[Eunie]] - "Grow the Snuff up!!"
	- You wanna' fight you wanna' die, what is your problem.
	- Apologized to Ahera
	- Ashera wants to leave her mark on this world. Sounds like Ethel to me
- ![[Pasted image 20231110165514.png]]
- Have they anticipated our moves? To enter the Capital? - [[Noah]]
	- Lots of containers here in the capital
	- Stealthy entrance... through the maintenance hatch
	- A flaw in the [[annihilator]]'s construction. We should try and destroy the neutralizer, but it's in the castle interior. Damage the auto-balancer
		- Got multiple things to wreck~
