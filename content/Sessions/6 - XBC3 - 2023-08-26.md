# Gameplay
## Chain Attacks
### Chat Advice
- *General rule of thumb*: Start orders with attackers, use healers to get to 99%, finish with defender (or high TP) to get bonuses
- Characters used to reactivate (like defenders) can be used again
	- One Character is reactivated at 100%
	- Two Characters at 150%
	- Three Characters at 200%+
- DIRECTION IS AUTOMATIC FOR ATTACKS (like side hit, back hit)
- some of the things that increase it are having the same role (attacker/defender/healer) as the chain order (it'll say at the top right, either the red attacker symbol, blue defender symbol, or green healer symbol) -F
- having the same affiliation (agnus/keves) as the character in the chain order (either the triangular keves symbol or the, other one i forget, will be shown up there in the top right too) -F
