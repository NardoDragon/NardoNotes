# Cammuravi
- Greated warrior in [[Agnus]]
- [[Ethel]] sparred with him
	- She beat him, which is what caused [[Colony 4]] to be demoted from Silver to Dirt

## Castle
- Was given a new [[Ferronis]] by the [[Kevesi Queen]] to take the main party out...
- Agreed to not be reborn. Takes blames for his colony's failings
- Takes his *own eye out* to prevent the consul from controlling him.
- Dies on the battlefield fighting [[Ethel]]. Exactly what he wanted.

> "A rematch with Cammuravi is everything. That will give purpose to the remainder of our lives" - [[Ethel]]
