# Noah
- Main Character :3
- We saw them in the opening scene in a Festival, time slowed down.
- Knew [[Eunie]], [[Lanz]], [[Joran]], [[Hoope]], [[Kite]] as kids
- The [[Homecoming]] happened on their second Term
	- Seems unconvinced that this is a good thing?
- In *9th Term*
- Doubtful that [[Colony 9]] can hit Silver Rank?
	- We don't know *why* he feels this way atm
- Had a conversation with [[Mio]] in Tableland (lmao) while looking at Armu's that they were getting old...
## [[Off-Seer]]
- Wants to learn to play his own melodies on the flute... Not JUST Off-Seer tunes
- Sent [[Consul K]] after his defeat
	- [[Lanz]], [[Taion]] and [[Mio]] were against it
	- [[Mio]] had a flashback of someone in her life about how [[Keves|Kevesi]] motes of light were just like [[Agnus]], decides to help send
## [[Alfreto Valley]]
- Fought one-on-one with [[Mio]] here
	- Knew how she fought because of her [[Agnus]] [[Off-Seer]] tune
- Heard some kind of high-pitched ringing…
	- Related to his weapon?
### [[Ouroborous Stone]]
- Shared memories with [[Mio]] when the stone was activated…
	- Could sense the pain that he and [[Colony 9]] had caused [[Agnus]]
## Desert
- The crew turns to **Noah** when [[Taion]] presents different choices of where to go
- Wants to take the safe route for [[Mio]]
	- Flashback to her Journal. To me this means he recognizes she doesn't have much time left and wants to make sure she stays safe
	- This is the *longer* route, also
# Weapon
- In a flashback to [[Colony 14]] when they were younger, told his friends he *couldn't call his weapon*
	- This wasn't true. He said he was "Afraid of this world..."
	- [[Ethel]] could tell this weapon was important in the past
- [[Riku]] gave him [[Lucky Seven]]
	- He keeps it sheathed inside of the weapon he uses in battle
- [[Mio]] could tell this weapon was important in the present
- Vibrates in the presence of [[Moebius]]
- When he unsheathed the sword in the fight against [[Consul K]], the sheath wrapped around his arm and became a glove
